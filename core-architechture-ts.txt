Understand how MCP connects clients, servers, and LLMs

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is built on a flexible, extensible architecture that enables seamless communication between LLM applications and integrations. This document covers the core architectural components and concepts.
​
Overview

MCP follows a client-server architecture where:

    Hosts are LLM applications (like Claude Desktop or IDEs) that initiate connections
    Clients maintain 1:1 connections with servers, inside the host application
    Servers provide context, tools, and prompts to clients

Core components
​
Protocol layer

The protocol layer handles message framing, request/response linking, and high-level communication patterns.

class Protocol<Request, Notification, Result> {
    // Handle incoming requests
    setRequestHandler<T>(schema: T, handler: (request: T, extra: RequestHandlerExtra) => Promise<Result>): void

    // Handle incoming notifications
    setNotificationHandler<T>(schema: T, handler: (notification: T) => Promise<void>): void

    // Send requests and await responses
    request<T>(request: Request, schema: T, options?: RequestOptions): Promise<T>

    // Send one-way notifications
    notification(notification: Notification): Promise<void>
}

Key classes include:

    Protocol
    Client
    Server

​
Transport layer

The transport layer handles the actual communication between clients and servers. MCP supports multiple transport mechanisms:

    Stdio transport
        Uses standard input/output for communication
        Ideal for local processes

    HTTP with SSE transport
        Uses Server-Sent Events for server-to-client messages
        HTTP POST for client-to-server messages

All transports use JSON-RPC 2.0 to exchange messages. See the specification for detailed information about the Model Context Protocol message format.
​
Message types

MCP has these main types of messages:

    Requests expect a response from the other side:

interface Request {
  method: string;
  params?: { ... };
}

Results are successful responses to requests:

interface Result {
  [key: string]: unknown;
}

Errors indicate that a request failed:

interface Error {
  code: number;
  message: string;
  data?: unknown;
}

Notifications are one-way messages that don’t expect a response:

    interface Notification {
      method: string;
      params?: { ... };
    }

​
Connection lifecycle
​
1. Initialization
ServerClientServerClientConnection ready for useinitialize requestinitialize responseinitialized notification

    Client sends initialize request with protocol version and capabilities
    Server responds with its protocol version and capabilities
    Client sends initialized notification as acknowledgment
    Normal message exchange begins

​
2. Message exchange

After initialization, the following patterns are supported:

    Request-Response: Client or server sends requests, the other responds
    Notifications: Either party sends one-way messages

​
3. Termination

Either party can terminate the connection:

    Clean shutdown via close()
    Transport disconnection
    Error conditions

​
Error handling

MCP defines these standard error codes:

enum ErrorCode {
  // Standard JSON-RPC error codes
  ParseError = -32700,
  InvalidRequest = -32600,
  MethodNotFound = -32601,
  InvalidParams = -32602,
  InternalError = -32603
}

SDKs and applications can define their own error codes above -32000.

Errors are propagated through:

    Error responses to requests
    Error events on transports
    Protocol-level error handlers

​
Implementation example

Here’s a basic example of implementing an MCP server:

import { Server } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";

const server = new Server({
  name: "example-server",
  version: "1.0.0"
}, {
  capabilities: {
    resources: {}
  }
});

// Handle requests
server.setRequestHandler(ListResourcesRequestSchema, async () => {
  return {
    resources: [
      {
        uri: "example://resource",
        name: "Example Resource"
      }
    ]
  };
});

// Connect transport
const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
await server.connect(transport);

​
Best practices
​
Transport selection

    Local communication
        Use stdio transport for local processes
        Efficient for same-machine communication
        Simple process management

    Remote communication
        Use SSE for scenarios requiring HTTP compatibility
        Consider security implications including authentication and authorization

​
Message handling

    Request processing
        Validate inputs thoroughly
        Use type-safe schemas
        Handle errors gracefully
        Implement timeouts

    Progress reporting
        Use progress tokens for long operations
        Report progress incrementally
        Include total progress when known

    Error management
        Use appropriate error codes
        Include helpful error messages
        Clean up resources on errors

​
Security considerations

    Transport security
        Use TLS for remote connections
        Validate connection origins
        Implement authentication when needed

    Message validation
        Validate all incoming messages
        Sanitize inputs
        Check message size limits
        Verify JSON-RPC format

    Resource protection
        Implement access controls
        Validate resource paths
        Monitor resource usage
        Rate limit requests

    Error handling
        Don’t leak sensitive information
        Log security-relevant errors
        Implement proper cleanup
        Handle DoS scenarios

​
Debugging and monitoring

    Logging
        Log protocol events
        Track message flow
        Monitor performance
        Record errors

    Diagnostics
        Implement health checks
        Monitor connection state
        Track resource usage
        Profile performance

    Testing
        Test different transports
        Verify error handling
        Check edge cases
        Load test servers
