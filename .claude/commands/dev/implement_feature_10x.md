## ðŸš€ 10X INTELLIGENT FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION
**Claude, implement features using INDUSTRY-LEADING practices with COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE, VECTOR SEARCH, and AUTO-DOCUMENTATION.**

### ðŸ”¥ **PHASE 1: ENHANCED MARKET-INFORMED FEATURE RESEARCH** (use "think hard")
- **websearch**: "how [top_3_competitors] implement [feature_type]"
- **gpt-researcher**: Comprehensive research on feature implementation best practices and industry patterns
- **github**: Search highest-starred projects with similar features
- **fetch**: Analyze competitor implementations
- **memory**: Review relevant protocols and patterns
- **memory**: Access stored successful feature implementation patterns
- **qdrant**: Vector-based semantic search for similar feature implementation patterns and successful architectures
- **meilisearch**: Full-text search through organizational implementation knowledge and proven approaches

### âš¡ **PHASE 2: INTELLIGENCE-DRIVEN PLANNING**
- **Market positioning** vs competitors with feature differentiation strategy
- **Performance targets** based on industry benchmarks and scalability requirements
- **Security patterns** from latest threat intelligence and compliance standards
- **Testing strategy** with comprehensive coverage and validation approaches
- **Documentation requirements** for technical and user-facing documentation

### ðŸŽ¯ **PHASE 3: RESEARCH-BACKED IMPLEMENTATION**
- **Test-first development** with industry patterns and comprehensive test coverage
- **Implementation** with proven code patterns and architectural best practices
- **Performance optimization** using industry techniques and benchmarking
- **Security hardening** with latest security patterns and vulnerability mitigation
- **Memory storage** of successful implementation patterns for future reuse

### ðŸ“š **PHASE 4: COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENTATION GENERATION**
**After successful implementation, AUTOMATICALLY execute:**
- **/docs:generate_docs_10x** to create comprehensive feature documentation including:
  - **Technical documentation**: API specs, architecture diagrams, implementation details
  - **User documentation**: Feature guides, tutorials, and usage examples  
  - **Developer documentation**: Code comments, architectural decisions, patterns used
  - **Testing documentation**: Test strategies, coverage reports, validation procedures
  - **Deployment documentation**: Configuration, monitoring, and maintenance guides

### ðŸš€ **PHASE 5: INTELLIGENT GIT WORKFLOW & COLLABORATION**
**After documentation generation is complete, AUTOMATICALLY execute:**
- **/git:smart_commit_10x** to create intelligent commit with comprehensive details including:
  - **Feature summary**: Concise description of implemented feature and its benefits
  - **Documentation references**: Links to generated documentation files and locations
  - **Implementation details**: Technical approach, patterns used, and architectural decisions
  - **Testing coverage**: Test results, coverage metrics, and validation outcomes
  - **Performance metrics**: Benchmarking results and optimization achievements
  - **Security considerations**: Security patterns implemented and threat mitigations

**Commit Message Template:**
```
