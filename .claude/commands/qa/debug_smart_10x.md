## ðŸš€ 10X INTELLIGENT DEBUGGING WITH SEQUENTIAL THINKING
**Claude, debug issues using SEQUENTIAL THINKING MCP and GLOBAL SOLUTION INTELLIGENCE.**
### ðŸ”¥ **PHASE 1: SEQUENTIAL PROBLEM ANALYSIS** (use "think")
- **filesystem**: Analyze error logs and stack traces systematically
- **websearch**: "[error_message] common causes solutions"
- **memory**: Check previous similar debugging sessions
- **github**: Search for similar issues in related projects
### âš¡ **PHASE 2: SYSTEMATIC DEBUGGING EXECUTION** (use "think harder")
- Hypothesis formation based on research
- Incremental testing with step-by-step validation
- Root cause isolation through systematic elimination
- Solution validation with comprehensive testing
âœ… Systematic analysis, research-backed solutions, comprehensive testing
