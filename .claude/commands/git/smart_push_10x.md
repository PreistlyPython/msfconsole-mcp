## üöÄ 10X SMART PUSH & SECURITY ORCHESTRATOR
*Secure Git Push with Comprehensive Security Scanning and Intelligent Validation*

**Claude, execute SECURE GIT PUSH with COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY SCANNING, INTELLIGENT VALIDATION, and ROBUST SAFETY PROTOCOLS.**

### üõ°Ô∏è **SECURITY-FIRST PUSH PROTOCOL** (use "think hard")

**CRITICAL: Execute ALL security checks BEFORE any push operation. Never skip security validation.**

### ‚ö° **PHASE 1: PRE-PUSH SECURITY VALIDATION** (use "ultrathink")

**1.1 Comprehensive Security Scanning**
- **filesystem**: Scan entire codebase for security vulnerabilities and sensitive data
- **virustotal**: Security analysis of all modified files and dependencies
- **memory**: Check against known security vulnerability patterns from organizational history
- **sqlite**: Query historical security issues and prevention patterns

**1.2 Sensitive Data Detection**
- **filesystem**: Deep scan for hardcoded secrets, API keys, passwords, tokens
- **memory**: Cross-reference against organizational security policies and known patterns
- **qdrant**: Vector-based similarity search for potential sensitive data patterns
- **meilisearch**: Full-text search through codebase for security-related keywords

### üîç **PHASE 2: INTELLIGENT PUSH VALIDATION** (use "ultrathink")

**2.1 Git Repository Security Analysis**
- Verify remote repository security and HTTPS connections
- Check branch protection rules and commit signature requirements
- Validate push permissions and repository access policies
- Detect potential merge conflicts and large file additions

**2.2 Advanced Safety Checks**
- Fetch latest remote changes and analyze conflicts
- Verify working directory is clean and ready for push
- Validate commit messages contain no sensitive information
- Check for force push attempts on protected branches

### üöÄ **PHASE 3: SECURE PUSH EXECUTION** (use "ultrathink")

**ONLY proceed if ALL security checks pass:**
- Execute graduated push strategy with monitoring
- Verify push success and remote repository synchronization
- Create comprehensive security audit trail
- Document push event with security validation results

### üìä **SECURITY DOCUMENTATION & LEARNING**
- `Knowledge/security/push_security_audit_$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S).md` - Security validation results
- **memory**: Store security validation patterns for organizational learning
- **sqlite**: Track security compliance metrics and improvement patterns

### üõ°Ô∏è **SECURITY FAILURE PROTOCOLS**
**IF ANY SECURITY CHECK FAILS: PUSH BLOCKED**
- Document security findings immediately
- Provide remediation guidance and best practices
- Block push operation until all security issues resolved
- Trigger security team notification if configured

‚úÖ Zero sensitive data exposure, comprehensive vulnerability scanning, policy compliance
